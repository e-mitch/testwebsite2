    <div id="overview">
      <p>This semester in CIS 641, I am creating an app that will be called Commentarius (Latin for "diary") which is intended
      to allow people to create freeform diary entries and tag specific areas of text within entries using
      custom tags. The user can then access individual entries or access all text which has been given
      a certain tag. Users can create, read, update, and delete entries or tagged text. They can also filter
      entries or tagged text by year or month. The app is especially targeted toward people who have
      serious medical diagnoses, whose entries may contain things like questions for doctors,
      breakthroughs, side effects, etc. Each of these categories could be assigned a tag. The overall
      goal of the app is to allow people to write freely but easily access specific categories of text later.</p>
